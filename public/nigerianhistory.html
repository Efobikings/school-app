                    <h3>Page 1: Geographic and Cultural Overview</h3>
                    <p>Nigeria is located in West Africa, bordered by Niger to the north, Chad to the northeast, Cameroon to the east, and Benin to the west. To the south, its coast lies on the Gulf of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean. Nigeria is known for its diverse cultures and ethnic groups, with over 250 ethnicities, the largest being the Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo.</p>

                    <h3>Page 3: Pre-Colonial Nigeria</h3>
                    <p>Before the arrival of Europeans, Nigeria was home to various advanced civilizations and kingdoms such as the Nok culture, which is known for its terracotta sculptures, the Kingdom of Nri, and the Yoruba city-states like Ife and Oyo. These societies had complex social structures, economies, and rich cultural traditions.</p>

                    <h3>Page 7: The Arrival of Europeans</h3>
                    <p>The Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in Nigeria in the late 15th century. They were followed by the British, who gradually established control over the region through treaties and military conquest.</p>

                    <h3>Page 11: The Transatlantic Slave Trade</h3>
                    <p>From the 16th to the 19th century, Nigeria was a major hub for the transatlantic slave trade. Millions of Nigerians were forcibly taken to the Americas, profoundly impacting the region's societies and economies.</p>

                    <p>In the late 19th century, Britain consolidated its control over Nigeria, establishing it as a colony in 1914. British colonial rule brought significant changes to Nigeria's political, economic, and social structures, often exploiting its resources and people.</p>

                    <h3>Page 21: The Struggle for Independence</h3>
                    <p>The struggle for Nigerian independence gained momentum after World War II. Nationalist movements, led by figures like Nnamdi Azikiwe, Obafemi Awolowo, and Ahmadu Bello, pressured the British government to grant independence. Nigeria finally gained its independence on October 1, 1960.</p>

                    <p>The post-independence period was marked by significant challenges, including ethnic tensions, economic difficulties, and political instability. The First Republic was overthrown in a military coup in 1966, leading to a series of military and civilian governments.</p>

                    <p>The Nigerian Civil War, also known as the Biafran War, took place from 1967 to 1970. It was caused by secessionist movements in the Eastern Region, which declared itself the Republic of Biafra. The war resulted in significant loss of life and devastation but ultimately ended with the reintegration of Biafra into Nigeria.</p>

                    <p>Nigeria has one of the largest economies in Africa, primarily driven by oil exports.
